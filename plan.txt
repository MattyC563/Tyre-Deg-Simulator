Goal: Predict how the tyre degradation will affect lap time.
How: Using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy etc

Steps:
1. Use NumPy and Pandas to clean the data, such as:
    - removing outlier laps (safety cars, vsc, red flags, in laps, outlaps, any outliers)
    - adapting the data so that the fuel loss doesn't affect lap times (lap times should in theory increase)
    - clean air laps preferably
    - categorise into whether laps utilised drs or not

2. Use machine learning stuff to find facts about of the data.
